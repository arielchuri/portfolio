                    <p>
                        I am documenting my journey into learning artificial intelligence.

                    <h2 id="linear-regression">Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling
                        the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more
                        independent variables. Let <strong>X</strong> be the independent
                        variable and <strong>Y</strong> be the dependent variable. We will
                        define a linear relationship between these two variables as follows:</p>
                    <p>Source: <a
                                   href="http://www.nabla.hr/SlopeInterceptLineEqu.gif">http://www.nabla.hr/SlopeInterceptLineEqu.gif</a></p>
                    <p>This is the equation for a line that you studied in high school.
                        <strong>m</strong> is the slope of the line and <strong>c</strong> is
                        the y intercept. Today we will use this equation to train our model with
                        a given dataset and predict the value of <strong>Y</strong> for any
                        given value of <strong>X</strong>. Our challenge today is to determine
                        the value of <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>, such that the
                        line corresponding to those values is the best fitting line or gives the
                        minimum error.</p>
                    <h2 id="loss-function">Loss Function</h2>
                    <p>The loss is the error in our predicted value of <strong>m</strong>
                        and <strong>c</strong>. Our goal is to minimize this error to obtain the
                        most accurate value of <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>.<br />
                        We will use the Mean Squared Error function to calculate the loss. There
                        are three steps in this function:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Find the difference between the actual y and predicted y value(y =
                            mx + c), for a given x.</li>
                        <li>Square this difference.</li>
                        <li>Find the mean of the squares for every value in X.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Mean Squared Error Equation</p>
                    <p>Here yᵢ is the actual value and ȳᵢ is the predicted value. Lets
                        substitute the value of ȳᵢ:</p>
                    <p>Substituting the value of ȳᵢ</p>
                    <p>So we square the error and find the mean. hence the name Mean Squared
                        Error. Now that we have defined the loss function, lets get into the
                        interesting part — minimizing it and finding <strong>m</strong> and
                        <strong>c.</strong></p>
                    <h2 id="the-gradient-descent-algorithm">The Gradient Descent
                        Algorithm</h2>
                    <p>Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm to find the
                        minimum of a function. Here that function is our Loss Function.</p>
                    <p><strong>Understanding Gradient Descent</strong></p>
                    <p>Illustration of how the gradient descent algorithm works</p>
                    <p>Imagine a valley and a person with no sense of direction who wants to
                        get to the bottom of the valley. He goes down the slope and takes large
                        steps when the slope is steep and small steps when the slope is less
                        steep. He decides his next position based on his current position and
                        stops when he gets to the bottom of the valley which was his goal.<br />
                        Let’s try applying gradient descent to <strong>m</strong> and
                        <strong>c</strong> and approach it step by step:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Initially let m = 0 and c = 0. Let L be our learning rate. This
                            controls how much the value of <strong>m</strong> changes with each
                            step. L could be a small value like 0.0001 for good accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Calculate the partial derivative of the loss function with respect
                            to m, and plug in the current values of x, y, m and c in it to obtain
                            the derivative value <strong>D</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Derivative with respect to <strong>m</strong></p>
                    <p>Dₘ is the value of the partial derivative with respect to
                        <strong>m</strong>. Similarly lets find the partial derivative with
                        respect to <strong>c</strong>, Dc :</p>
                    <p>Derivative with respect to <strong>c</strong></p>
                    <p>3. Now we update the current value of <strong>m</strong> and
                        <strong>c</strong> using the following equation:</p>
                    <p>4. We repeat this process until our loss function is a very small
                        value or ideally 0 (which means 0 error or 100% accuracy). The value of
                        <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong> that we are left with now will
                        be the optimum values.</p>
                    <p>Now going back to our analogy, <strong>m</strong> can be considered
                        the current position of the person. <strong>D</strong> is equivalent to
                        the steepness of the slope and <strong>L</strong> can be the speed with
                        which he moves. Now the new value of <strong>m</strong> that we
                        calculate using the above equation will be his next position, and
                        <strong>L×D</strong> will be the size of the steps he will take. When
                        the slope is more steep (<strong>D</strong> is more) he takes longer
                        steps and when it is less steep (<strong>D</strong> is less), he takes
                        smaller steps. Finally he arrives at the bottom of the valley which
                        corresponds to our loss = 0.<br />
                        Now with the optimum value of <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>
                        our model is ready to make predictions !</p>

                        I was hired as a consultant to span the roles from product development to UI design for this innovative prototype.
                        The objective was to create a working, proof-of-concept prototype that could be used for both testing and presentation.
                        I worked directly with AI scientists and end users.
