  Interview with Virginia Louise Brown [1/14/2004]

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Virginia L. Brown is being interviewed today on January the 14th,
    2004 at the Army Residence Community in San Antonio, Texas. She's a
    member of the Women's Overseas Service League, which is sponsoring
    this taping. The interviewer is Ruth Stewart, assisted by Carol
    Havgood. Ginny, how about starting in by telling us a little bit,
    just summarize your early life where you were born, brought up, and
    how you got interested in nursing and then eventually the military.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I was born in Johnson City, Tennessee, in 1921. I lived in town for
    a while, and my family moved to the country. And I was out there for
    a good 10, 15 years. And I was hit by a car, and I was hospitalized
    for a week, and that was -- that's what caused me to decide I'd like
    to be a nurse. And then I was in the hospital a few times after that
    as a result of this car accident. And we had worked on a farm and
    walked to school about three miles.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Each way?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Each way. Sometimes we got a ride. In the wintertime a neighbor
    would take us to school. His daughter was in the same school I was.
    Until high school. And we walked or rode the streetcar. Walked a
    half a mile and then got the streetcar. And I graduated from Science
    Hill High School in 1939. And I was in the band and the orchestra.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    What instrument did you play?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    In the orchestra I played the oboe, and in the band I played the
    glockenspiel and the symbols.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Interesting.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I went a short time to East Tennessee State University -- it was
    College then -- at Johnson City. But money was short, so I had to
    get out. And then I applied for a school of nursing in Memphis,
    Tennessee. The Baptist Memorial Hospital school of nursing. And I
    entered in 1940 and graduated in 1943.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And then what? Did you work as a nurse?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I went into the Army.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    You went directly into the Army?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Well, I had to wait to pass state boards, because we graduated
    before state boards. And I went home and I worked in an ENT hospital
    for I guess a month. And then I worked in the general hospital there
    for a couple weeks. And then I went into the Army. July 21st, 1943.
    And reported to Kennedy General Hospital.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Kinsey?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Kennedy General Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And that was a military hospital?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yes. No longer there. It was turned into a Veterans hospital, and
    then they tore it down not too long ago, so.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So then go on about -- a little bit about what went on after that
    when you got really into the Army Nurse Corps activities and tours.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Well, it -- in Kennedy General it was an interesting assignment
    because having never been in the military, you wondered what you
    were going to do. And some of the time we had to get the basics like
    marching and how to salute, that sort of stuff. After duty hours.
    And I worked on a surgical ward, and then I was transferred to a GE
    ward. And I was only there for six months. I volunteered to go
    overseas. And so in 19 -- December of 1943, I joined the 48th
    General Hospital, which was stationed there. And by the first part
    of December, I don't remember the exact date, we went to Camp
    Kilmer, New Jersey for departing overseas. And we were there getting
    field clothes and shots. And then we were supposed to go out on the
    Ile-de-France on Christmas day. And we got on board, and then we had
    to get off because something's wrong with the engine. And so then we
    went back to Kilmer and stayed a week. And on New Year's Day we
    sailed for England on the Queen Elizabeth.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    That was in '44?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    January, '44. We landed in Glasgow, Scotland, on the 10th of
    January, and was -- got on trains and went from there, Scotland, all
    the way to southern part of England, Petworth. Petworth, England. We
    were stationed in a camp that had been occupied by the Canadians.
    And I don't think they ever washed anything, but we were so tired
    when we got in it didn't matter. We put towels over the pillows
    because they smelled so. And just pulled up the blankets and went to
    sleep. One of the interesting things that went on in Petworth, which
    most people said they never had, we had strikers to come in and keep
    our stoves going. There were potbellied stoves. And so the enlisted
    people, whoever was assigned to that, made rounds every so often and
    made sure your stoves were burning.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    What kind of building were you in?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Well, it was like a four-sided quarters. There were two people in
    each side and there were four of us there. They were all separated,
    had this door that go in.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And all of you were nurses?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yes. It was interesting to wake up in the middle night and see guys
    poking your stove. But he was very nice. Then we had nothing to do
    there but get back to England. We took in some of the sights there a
    few times. Had to walk to breakfast. I don't remember eating dinner
    very much. But I guess we did, but it was a mess hall.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    But it was a mess hall type of situation?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yeah.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And you really weren't assigned to any nursing duties at that point?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No, not then. We stayed --

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So how long were you there?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I guess about a month. And then we got on a train and went up to
    Swindon, England. And I don't remember the dates. But we lived with
    English families.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Oh.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    And it was rather interesting and, you know, apprehensive a little
    bit. Because they put us in a truck with our baggage, and they'd go
    along a street and view -- they wanted one or two, it depended on
    where you were sitting. I was sitting by myself, I guess. And I got
    selected to go into this house. And it's really scary because you
    didn't know these people. They didn't give us any phone number to
    call if we got into trouble. And the people were very nice, but it's
    rather interesting to go into a place that you don't know the people
    and you're going to stay there a week or two. The people I stayed
    with, I think the gentleman worked for the railroad company. It was
    a man and his wife and one daughter, 12-year-old. This lady -- they
    were very nice to me. We were not allowed to eat with them unless we
    were particularly invited. And then we had to take some coffee or
    whatever, get it from the mess hall.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Why were you assigned to live with families?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    There were no billets there in Swindon.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Then after a week what happened? You said --

Virginia Louise Brown:

    We were there for a month, I think.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Oh. Longer than -- I was thinking a week, but.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No, month.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So. But you didn't stay on in Swindon, then, longer than that?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No, no.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Okay.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    But while there, some of us got detailed -- I got detailed to the
    Air Force, British Air Force Hospital which was near there. We were
    week's duty. And they did things a little different than we do. Like
    they give all their baths in the afternoon. In the mornings the
    nurse goes by and straightens up the beds, and they get breakfast.
    And about 10:00 somebody is assigned to make the toast and tea,
    because they got tea and toast every morning at 10:00. Sometimes we
    were detailed to do that. I don't remember doing very much there.
    But they had a matron who was head of the ward, and a couple nurses.
    And lunchtime was interesting because we all went to lunch at the
    same time, set at a big table, about this. And there was one lady
    set at the head table, and you didn't eat anything until she did. It
    was all passed around. You might be hungry, but you didn't dare take
    more than one helping of food because they didn't have -- there
    wasn't a lot there.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Interesting.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    And at the end of the day a bus picked us up and took us back to our
    building. And I don't remember the little town that this hospital
    was in. But I think there were about four of us got detailed to that
    hospital. And interesting part too in Swindon is the lady did not
    want, at least me, coming back to the house after breakfast. She did
    not want me coming there in the afternoon. So our things and
    everything closed at 4:30. So you were in a quandary because they
    had high tea at 4:00 something and dinner at 8:00. So you just went
    home, or just went there about dark and hoped that you didn't
    disturb them too much. But otherwise, we had been going to the Red
    Cross, the nurses. But then they said, well, we couldn't come back
    there anymore. I don't know why they thought we disturbed anybody,
    but we didn't. So then we ended up finding a pub that had a -- you
    know, in England they have these other rooms that we could stay in
    during the morning.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Hang out?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yeah. We used to get food on the street. They had fish and chips,
    which were delicious. I know this lady was -- that I stayed with,
    Mrs. Beasis asked me to dinner one night, and she asked me what I
    wanted for dinner. What do you say to somebody who doesn't have --
    and I said, "Well, I don't know. But how about fish and chips?" And
    she said, "Well, where do you get them?" I said, "They're just right
    down the street there." And she said, "Oh." So for dinner that night
    I think we took butter -- and she said I could invite a friend --
    butter, and I don't know, coffee, I think. And we had -- I'd never
    had it. It was pressed tongue. Great big thing on the table, in
    gelatin. And pretty good. I thought, "If you don't like it, you got
    to eat it anyhow," so. Then I asked for a cup of coffee, and that
    was a sad mistake. Because they had coffee like extract in a bottle.
    And they had a lot of water and they poured a tablespoonful of that
    in it. I thought, "Oh, my." I tried to drink it. It's difficult. And
    she was very nice. Because my feet always got cold, and they're --
    they didn't have heat at night I guess. So she loaned me a pair of
    her husband's wool socks and she'd bring me tea every morning before
    I got out of bed. So by the time I got myself awake to drink it, it
    was cold. But it was very nice of her to bring that up. And she was
    nice enough to write my family and tell them I was there, and what a
    nice daughter they had.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Good credentials.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yeah. And then from Swindon we went to Winchester -- Winchester,
    England. And we took over a hospital. It was a general hospital. And
    then we were there when D-Day started. It was interesting, about a
    couple days before all our troops were going over, planes were
    flying over our hospital wing tip to wing tip as far as you could see.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And where was this now?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Winchester.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Okay.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    And we had Quonset type hospitals. You know, wards. And then we'd
    begin to get patients when they were going over to France. I guess
    some of them got in the water. Some of them -- but we did get them
    from the coast of France. Rather interesting, because I guess
    somebody was sorting them up when they came in. But we'd get
    patients. And all the doctors were scheduled to go to surgery. And
    our ward officer was going, or went. We didn't know we were getting
    patients, so I was staying one day to help a nurse admit some
    patients. And about 8:00 the supervisor came down and asked me what
    I was doing there. I said, "Well, I was helping her get these
    patients in." "Well, you better go home because you have to come
    back at 11:00." So we worked eight hours on and eight hours off for
    about a week. Our corpsman, I think, had to work 12 and 12 or
    something. Because sometimes when we weren't busy they could go in
    the linen room and have a nap. But there were no -- I guess there
    were some controls. But when a patient would go to surgery from your
    ward, they'd come back and there was no indication what ward they
    were going to do. So I know they were wheeling in a patient in our
    ward, and I saw him and I said, "He doesn't belong here." So he went
    across the hall, but.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    But the nurses themselves had to do the controlling about the
    dispatching, if you will?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    And the ward officer, when he went to surgery he said to the other
    nurse and I -- because there was no ward officer on the ward at the
    time -- "Do whatever you have to do, pain medicine and whatever.
    I'll cover you when I get back." But they sent -- usually had
    written orders when they came from surgery, so that was no problem.
    They had evac'd patients pretty soon, so would get them. Of course
    you had to keep the lights out, so we were using lanterns to -- I
    guess I shouldn't -- I'll tell you this later when that's cut off.
    But we had to get them ready, and then they'd come in at night and
    we'd have to strip off their clothes and help them get ready for
    surgery. Most of them are gone. And then I don't remember the date
    that someone else replacing our hospital, but we went down on the
    coast of England for a couple weeks, but I was detailed back to that
    hospital to work for two weeks. And so when we got back to our unit
    on the coast, why, our stuff was all packed and we went to
    Southampton, shipping over. This is August. We left the 10th of
    August, I think, and landed in France the 17th of August. And that
    was an interesting thing. It was on a British ship. And if you
    weren't seasick, you were after you got smelling the fish that they
    had for breakfast. But to get off of that ship you had to go down
    the side on a rope. You know, one of those mesh things. And get a
    bouncing LST boat that's sitting at the near. And on you you had a
    purse, a pistol belt, a backpack, a bedroll, a helmet. So you hoped
    you landed when it came up and not when it missed.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Pretty tricky.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Then we landed in, I think -- I know it wasn't a week we were on
    that ship. But sometime about the 17th of August or something. And
    we -- first off, we went to a field, and we always wondered why they
    wanted us to set up -- learn how to set up pup tents. Well, in this
    area all the nurses had to put up a pup tent. Two of you to a tent.
    And when it rained, if you touched it, it leaked in. But apparently
    somebody flew over and saw all these tents out there and the
    directions came back to get us in under a big tent. So we all had to
    move into a tent. We already -- they gave us cots.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    How long were you in the pup tent?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Oh, I don't think more than a week. But it's interesting because we
    got invited to a few parties and we had some pretty big nurses in
    the unit, and probably this is just funny, but I used to get tickled
    because most of us could get dressed in the pup tent, but they
    couldn't get their girdles on outside. So here they are outside of
    the tent pulling on these girdles. And we went to a party one night,
    and we were supposed to be back at 9:00. Well, we started way before
    that, but you had to drive without lights. And I guess the driver
    got lost, because we didn't get back until 1:00. And we all got
    restricted to the post for the duration. But the commanding officer
    went out, and he didn't get back one time either. So our
    restrictions was lifted, I guess. He thought we were fibbing or
    something. But out in that field and eating out of mess kits that
    you dumped in a barrel to clean. And the bees were swarming around.
    But it was interesting. I guess the commanding officer got mad at a
    physician and got -- was talking about the food, so they made him
    mess officer. And it was pretty good food after that. And we -- I
    don't know how long we stayed there. But then we got on -- oh, in
    getting baths, we rode in a truck for about 30 minutes to the
    showers. We got down about every other day. Of course you were about
    as dirty when you got back as you went because of the all the dust
    and stuff. But they were in open tents and the guys were up there
    controlling the water and looking down. So -- but it was nice to
    have a bath instead of out of a helmet. The -- we moved from there,
    and we were put on trains -- a train. And it seemed like it took us
    forever to get from there to our next field activity, which was
    outside of Paris. And an interesting thing happened there. The Red
    Cross lady asked me if I wanted to ride up in the train with her. I
    said, "Sure." So she asked the commanding officer and the chief
    nurse if we could go, and they said yes. Well, we had to have a male
    officer with us too. But we didn't have time to get on that train
    when it pulled out. And here we were back here in the middle of no
    place. And what tickled me, I guess I was silly, is this officer who
    was with us had a whistle, and he was blowing a whistle and the
    train was going.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    As though he could stop it.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    The train finally stopped. I don't know why, they were going and
    starting and going. But we got on the back end of the train and the
    train commander, whoever was commanding, came back and said, "Oh,
    get on up there if you're going to ride." So we got to ride on the
    train until it stopped at the next water tank, which wasn't very
    long. And then we got back in our -- with our regular group. But on
    the train, some people had seats, but we were like in caboose. And
    to sleep, they gave us stretchers to sleep on. You're better off on
    the floor because the air just came up through the stretchers. But
    that was better. Fairly comfortable. Next place we got was in
    another field outside of Paris, and it was in a potato patch. They
    put up tents and we'd have to -- if your cot was unsteady, you'd
    look around it and you're sitting on a potato. Our rations had gone
    -- had not come with us. They had gone up to L'Age, France. So we
    were sort of on skimpy rashes -- rations -- rations. Two meals a
    day. And so one day in a potato patch we asked the mess officer,
    "Could we have french fried potatoes?" Well, if we dug them. It's
    surprising the number of people didn't know how to dig potatoes. But
    we got the potatoes. Then we went up, there was nobody to peel them.
    So there was about four or five nurses. We peeled potatoes. Got them
    so they could french fry them. We french fried potatoes. Those were
    delicious. Shortly after that I got detailed to go into the 108th
    General Hospital in Paris. It was a week after Paris was liberated.
    And we stayed there about a week, and then they called us back and
    we moved into a hospital in Paris, the Lajure -- Larboisiere, which
    is right back of the Gare du Nord railroad station. And it was -- I
    guess we could get -- I don't remember how many patients. At one
    time on my ward I had 50 patients on that one ward because it was
    two beds down the middle of the center and on each side. And that
    was an orthopedic ward. And --

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So then how long were you in France overall?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    From when we landed in '44, to May or June of '45.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So almost a year. And then after you left France -- '45 was after --

Virginia Louise Brown:

    From Paris -- from Paris we went to Marseille. Some of us were --
    you know, at that time you got points. And the high points were
    allowed to come home. And those -- that broke up the units. And I
    went to the 69th Station Hospital down on the Riviera. And I was
    there about a month. And then we came back to Marseille. And I think
    I -- we sailed on 1st of September, because I got home the 15th of
    September.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Okay. And then you stayed in the Army, though, after that?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No, I got out.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    You didn't? Okay.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    '46, 1946. After all the leave and stuff, I got out.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    But then you went back in later, did you?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yeah. 1953. In the meantime, I went to school and I taught school.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Nursing, or otherwise?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Uh-huh, nursing school. Taught -- went back to the Baptist hospital
    and taught there for -- I think from '49 to '53.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    What decided you to go back in the Army?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    More pay.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    It's a good reason.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I was in the reserves, and I went on reserve duty. I think it was to
    McClellan. And the lady who was in charge of assignments was there,
    and she said, "Why don't you come back in the Army?" And she -- I
    said, "I don't know." So she -- she quoted the salary a hundred
    dollars more a month than I was making. And she said I could be --
    she said they needed instructors, and I could go instructor in
    school. I said that sounded great. So I put in my resignation from
    the Baptist hospital and reported into Walter Reed 5th of December,
    1940 -- '53.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    And then when were -- did you finally retire from the Army?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    1980.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    1980. And in that time you were stateside most of that time?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No, no. I was at Walter Reed at that time for two years. Then I went
    to Korea for a year, and then I went to Japan -- it was about 10
    months. And then in Japan for a year. Then I went stateside for two
    years to recruiting. From recruiting I went back to Walter Reed, and
    I was there six years because I got a -- went back to school, worked
    there. Long time ago.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    It's okay. You covered a variety of tours, then, during that period?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    For a year. And then Fort Bragg, Fort Ord, back overseas to Okinawa,
    back to -- I came back to Fort Sam -- from Okinawa -- I mean from
    Fort Ord to Okinawa -- Okinawa to Fort Ord to Fort Sam, and from
    Fort Sam to Europe, and Europe back to SGF in 1978.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So you certainly covered a lot of territory in your career. And all
    of that was in various aspects of nursing --

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yes.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    -- including teaching, recruitment?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Supervisor. Chief nurse. Chief nurse at health services community
    here. And then assistant chief to the Army Nurse Corps.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So then since you retired from the military --

Virginia Louise Brown:

    I've been involved with WSL. I've been involved with the Army
    Medical Museum. I've been involved with my hospital from overseas,
    48th General. I've been involved in needlepoint, sewing, quilting.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    What was the high point of your military career?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Most shocking, too, was selected for chief nurse of health services
    committee.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    We're now going to proceed a little further with your post -- or
    your last time, ending time in the Army Nurse Corps and some of the
    things that occurred during that period where you got some
    significant recognition.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    During World War II we had only -- nurses had relative rank. There
    was some regular Army nurses, but there were no nurses such as we
    knew of as reserve. I think it was 1947 that nurses received rank.
    But when we were leaving the Army, we were separated. We were not
    discharged. So we could be called back at any time. Also, I guess
    they didn't realize what nurses could contribute, because we had one
    commander when we started said that he did not need nurses, all he
    needed was doctors and corpsman. Later on, after receiving patients
    from D-Day and Battle of the Bulge and that sort of thing, he had a
    staff meeting and said he was wrong, nurses were essential and did a
    wonderful job. Rank at that time was a little different than what we
    have today, in that I don't think they had any routine way of
    promoting. Because we had been overseas a year. In our unit there
    was one captain, one lieutenant, and the rest of us were second
    lieutenants. We had two pre-Pearl Harbor nurses in the unit. And
    when we began to get nurses in our unit who had only been in six
    months and promoted to first lieutenant, we asked what was happening
    to us. So our nurses -- we did ave a meeting with the chief nurse,
    and we suggested that the pre-Pearl Harbor nurses be promoted first
    and then whoever they want to promote. We apparently had some others
    because they asked us who we wanted to be promoted. And you would
    think it was an open discussion, but I found out differently that
    when I got promoted in that time, all I did was post it on a chief
    nurse's door. If you didn't happen to go by there or somebody tell
    you, you didn't know. But I went in and got mine. And I met the
    chief of professional activities and my ward officer in the ward --
    on the road. And they didn't say congratulations. They said, "Well,
    you'd been promoted earlier if you learned to keep your mouth shut."
    I thought, "Okay." So I got promoted to first lieutenant there.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    That was when you were in France, while you were still in France?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    In France. Then throughout my career I've been promoted. At the time
    I went in as a reserve nurse and elected to join the regular Army in
    '58. And I retired as regular Army officer at -- we began -- it's
    interesting, because nurses were not often recognized by awards. My
    first one was 1965. And then I got them after that. One of the
    things that I'm very proud of is I was selected as the nurse of the
    year by the DAR in 1980. That's a program that the Army Nurse Corps
    is involved in. And I also was very surprised and very appreciative,
    I received the Distinguished Service Medal, DSM, which in the Army
    Nurse Corps is usually chief of the corps got it. I was the first
    nurse to get it after that. There have been a couple others since
    then have gotten the DASR. And also when you retire from the surgeon
    general's office with 30 years service they give you an Army medical
    department medallion, if you've got 30 years in.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So you have had an exceedingly distinguished career in the Army
    Nurse Corps throughout your career. Have there been any special
    emotions or feelings that have evolved in relation to being in war
    as a nurse from that experience?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    No. Except you wonder how the patients are going to do when they get
    home. Like they come -- I was only in World War II. I'm sure we got
    patients at other hospitals that were in war. But these were
    frostbite. The people had feet that were really injured. We got
    people who lost arms and legs. People who -- prisoners of war we got
    back. And you just wondered how they're going to make it, and what
    kind of things -- how they would react when they got home.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Did it change you in any way?

Virginia Louise Brown:

    More concerned about your patients, realizing what they'd been
    through. Sometimes they'd be a little upset. I can remember having a
    patient, he was a paratrooper, and those people are always very
    proud of their shoes. They always shine; you can see yourselves in
    them. And they were sitting at the foot of the bed, and I happened
    to hit them. Well, he got very upset. And I thought, "Well, there's
    no sense of doing anything because he's really having problems."

Ruth F. Stewart:

    That was his only control --

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Yeah.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    -- was his boots. Yeah.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    So things like that you'd often wonder. I always wondered too
    because -- and I guess I could understand, because I had some
    patients, I happened to be on night duty on an officers and enlisted
    ward, and they were ready to go back to duty. They went AWOL to get
    back to their unit. And I'm sure it was because they didn't want to
    go through a separation center or where they were reassigned to
    another unit. But I'm sure nothing was done to them once they back
    to their unit.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    Back in service.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Well, we were in Paris, and they went from there back to combat, to
    their unit.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    So the AWOL was ignored at that point, yeah. Interesting how rules
    get bent.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Well, if they went back to their unit, they were AWOL from the
    hospital but not from their unit.

Ruth F. Stewart:

    They can do that. Well, thank you so much for all this information.
    It's really valuable to have all this recorded and have it in our
    Veterans History Project. And we appreciate your time. Thank you.

Virginia Louise Brown:

    Thank you.
