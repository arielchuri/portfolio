Unilever is exploring the use of artificial intelligence to manage this complex task.
I worked the AI scientists to uncover the value that could be added into this system.
Through an iterative process, I developed wireframes and UI designs for a real-world, AI supply-chain management dashboard.
Through a series of interviews and design-thinking sessions with stake holders, I created the wireframes and UI for this innovative application.</p>
